## Overview
The Javascript Starting Template is a powerful and efficient starting point for your future web projects. It is built using Vite, a lightning-fast build tool, and Vanilla JavaScript to provide you with a clean and flexible foundation for your web applications.

## Features
- **Vite Build Tool**: The template harnesses the power of Vite's rapid development environment, offering instant server startup, fast hot module replacement (HMR), and efficient development builds. Say goodbye to waiting and hello to productivity!

- **Vanilla JavaScript**: Embrace the simplicity and flexibility of pure Vanilla JavaScript. This template avoids external frameworks and libraries, allowing you to build applications from scratch while keeping your codebase lightweight and easy to manage.

- **File-Based Routing**: Easily manage your application's routes with Vite's file-based routing system. The intuitive project structure enhances code navigation and readability, making development a breeze.
